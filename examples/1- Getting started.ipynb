    "## How to create a simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The sumo-experiments library has been designed within a scientific framework, to enable SUMO simulations to be run quickly and reproducibly. It is made up of a set of classes whose aim is to create a simulation, also known as an experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "A SUMO network must be made up of at least two elements: a set of infrastructures, and a set of vehicle flows. It can be completed by optional elements, such as the addition of cyclists, detectors or pedestrians. To launch a simulation, you must first instantiate generators for each of these elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once these elements have been instantiated, you can create an experience, in which you add them as parameters. You then configure the experiment with the parameters of your choice, and you're ready to go. Once the experiment is complete, you can extract the results in CSV format, and even plot them. \n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below summarizes the steps involved in creating an experiment."
