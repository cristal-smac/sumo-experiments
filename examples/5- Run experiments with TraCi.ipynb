    "# Run experiments with TraCi\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous tutorials, we learned how to run simulations with custom networks, and custom parameters. However, when a simulation is launched, it's not possible to interact with SUMO __during__ the execution. To overcome this problem, SUMO integrates a library named TraCi, allowing you to control simulations, simulation step by simulation step. At each step, it is therefore possible to modify the behavior of the infrastructures, for example by adapting them to the traffic, or to gather data for each simulation step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll learn how to use TraCi with sumo-experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The TraCiWrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "The `run_traci` function from Experiment can only accept one TraCi function. As we said previously, TraCi functions are meant to change infrastructures behaviour, and to collect data. This can be a lot for a unique function, and it can be useful to split tis work in multiple functions. That's why the TraciWrapper was created. The aim of this class is to aggregate TraCi functions to make only one. In this class, TraCi functions are divided in two types :\n",
    "- The behavioural functions are functions that modify the behaviour of the network. They return a new config dict, modified or not, to the TraCiWrapper that will use it for the next simulaton step.\n",
    "- The stats functions are functions that gather data from the network. They return a dict where the key in the name of the data, and where the value is the data. The data can't be an iterable object. The idea of this implementation is to collect a dict with the same data names for each simulation step and to build a Pandas DataFrame a the end of the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, there are two functions to add TraCi functions to the wrapper : `add_stats_function` to add a stats function, and `add_behavioural_function` to add a behavioural function. The aggregated function is named `final_function`.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note :** The TraciWrapper final function first executes the stats functions, and then the behavioural functions. It executes functions of each group __in the order in which they have been added__.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## TraCi behavioural functions for pre-set networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The pre-set networks from sumo-experiments implement behavioural functions. This is the main reason why detectors are also implemented. There are 3 different behavioural functions, that adapt traffic lights behaviour to detectors signals :\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `boolean_detection` must be used with detectors generated by the `generate_boolean_detectors` method. When a traffic light detects a car on a lane where traffic light is red, and if it doesn't detect any car on the green lanes, it switches to the other phase if the current phase is set since more than the minimum duration time. If this condition doesn't occur, the traffic light switch to the other phase when the current phase last for more than the maximum duration time. This strategy needs three parameters : `min_duration_tl` is the minimum duration (in seconds) for a traffic light phase, `max_duration_tl` is the maximum duration (in seconds) for a traffic light phase, and `simulation_duration` is the total simulation duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `numerical_detection_all_vehicles` must be used with detectors generated by the `generate_numerical_detectors` method. When a traffic light detect more than the threshold of cars on a lane where traffic light is red, it switches to the other phase if the current phase is set since more than the minimum duration time. Both stopped and running cars are considered in this strategy. If this condition doesn't occur, the traffic light switch to the other phase when the current phase last for more than the maximum duration time. This strategy needs four parameters : `min_duration_tl` is the minimum duration for a traffic light phase, `max_duration_tl` is the maximum duration for a traffic light phase, `vehicle_threshold` is the number of vehicles detected required to switch to another phase and `simulation_duration` is the total simulation duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `numerical_detections_stopped_vehicles` must be used with detectors generated by the `generate_numerical_detectors` method. When a traffic light detect more than the threshold of cars on a lane where traffic light is red, it switches to the other phase if the current phase is set since more than the minimum duration time. Only stopped cars are considered in this strategy. If this condition doesn't occur, the traffic light switch to the other phase when the current phase last for more than the maximum duration time. This strategy needs four parameters : `min_duration_tl` is the minimum duration for a traffic light phase, `max_duration_tl` is the maximum duration for a traffic light phase, `vehicle_threshold` is the number of vehicles detected required to switch to another phase and `simulation_duration` is the total simulation duration.\n",

    "## TraCi stats functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Sumo-experiments implements stats functions that can be used for any network. This functions iterate over all vehicles or all lanes to get data from them. They can aggregat this data differently (sum, mean, max, min, etc) according to type of function you choose. All of this functions can be imported from the `traci_util` package.\n",
